# lab1M

This Lab consisted of the addition of three new methods, which are listed below

int indexOf(Fraction input);
void add(int index, Fraction input);
Fraction remove (int index);

indexof returns the index (or location) of a fraction inside of the array.
add doesn't return a value. Instead, it add in a new fraction inside the array at any specific index
Remove method simplely removes the fraction located at a specific index. 

Due to lack of communication, each member created all three methods by themselves. 
After this lab, method assignments are now always given to evenly spread out work, and 
a way of communication outside of the classroom is established.
